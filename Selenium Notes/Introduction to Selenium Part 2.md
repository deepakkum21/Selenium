    -   Macintosh

-   **b) Application Environment**
    -   i) CUI based – Selenium doesn’t support.
    -   ii) Windows based-Selenium doesn’t support.
    -   iii) Web based- Selenium supports.
    -   iv) Mobile based- Supports Mobile Applications which have Web forms.

-   **c) Programming Environment**
    -   Java
    -   C#
    -   Python
    -   Perl
    -   Ruby
    -   PHP
*Note: Selenium IDE doesn’t support any programming language.*

-   **d) Browser Environment**

    -   Safari
    -   Opera etc…
*Note: Selenium IDE supports Firefox Browser only.*

## 5. Selenium License
All Selenium Projects released under the Apache 2.0 License
- Anybody can download and use all Selenium projects with free of cost.
- Anybody can modify the source code and distribute the source code.                            
**Selling modified code is not allowed.**

## 6. Testing Frameworks and Other tools used in Selenium
-  **Testing Frameworks**
    - JUnit Framework
    - TestNG Framework

**Eclipse IDE –**
-   To create and execute Java programs,
-   Add Selenium WebDriver .jar files to Java project and use Webdriver features.
-   Install TestNG/JUnit Testing Frameworks

-   Firebug and Firepath plug ins (Mozilla Firefox) for inspecting elements in Firefox browser.
-   Note: Google Chrome and IE browsers have built Developer tools (F12) to inspect elements.
-   Browser Drivers for Cross Browser Testing
-   For Google Chrome, IE etc… Browsers, download Browser drivers and set driver path in test scripts.

## 7. Selenium Environment Setup

**Choose Selenium Tools**
-   Selenium WebDriver to create Test cases.
-   Java as Programming Language
-   TestNG Framework as Test Runner.
-   Firebug and Firepath plug in for Mozilla browser to inspect Elements.
-   Browser Drivers etc…

**Configure Selenium:**
-    Download Eclipse IDE and extract
-    Download Java software and Install.
-    Set Environment variable (Path variable).
-    Download Selenium WebDriver java language binding (seleniumhq.org) and add WebDriver jar file to Java project in Eclipse IDE.
-    Download and install Firebug and Firepath from Mozilla browser to inspect elements.
-    Download IE, Chrome etc… Browser drivers.
-    Download and install TestNG Testing Framework from Eclipse IDE

## 8. Advantages of Selenium
-   i) It is an Open source Software.
-   ii) It supports various Operating environments (Windows, Linux, Mac etc…)
-   iii) It supports various browsers (IE, Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, safari, Opera etc…)
-   iv) It supports various programming environments (Java, Perl, Python, Ruby and PHP)
-   v) It supports parallel Test execution.
-   vi) It uses less Hardware resources.

## 9. Disadvantages of Selenium
-   i) It supports Web based Applications only.
-   ii) No reliable support from anybody.
-   iii) No centralized maintenance of Elements/objects
-   iv) Difficult to setup environment.
-   v) Difficult to use.
-   vi) Limited support for Image based testing.
-   vii) New features may not work properly.
-   viii) No other tool integration for test management.
-   ix) No built in Reporting facility.
